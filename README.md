## Project Title: Road Accident Trends Analysis
### Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze road accident data to uncover critical patterns, causes, and trends associated with road safety. This analysis helps identify critical insights into accident frequency, causes, locations, and time patterns to support informed decision-making for reducing road accidents and improving public safety.

### Data Source
Kaggle: Publicly available road accident dataset from Kaggle, containing detailed records of accident locations, causes, time, severity, and environmental factors.

### Tools & Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization
* Jupyter Notebook: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Reporting

### Key Insights
* A total of 307,973 accidents were recorded in the dataset.
* Out of these, 263,280 accidents (85.5%) were classified as slight, 40,740 (13.2%) as serious, and 3,904 (1.3%) were fatal.
* Friday had the highest number of accidents (50,529), while Sunday had the fewest (33,544), indicating a higher risk towards   the end of the workweek.
* The majority of accidents, 227,286 cases (73.8%), occurred during daylight conditions.
* 60,093 accidents happened at night with street lights lit, while only 1,142 occurred in darkness with unlit roads.
* Most accidents occurred in fine weather with no high winds (244,496 cases, 79.4%), suggesting that poor weather is not the    primary factor for most incidents.
* Rain without high winds accounted for 37,841 accidents, making it the second most common weather condition during accidents
* Urban areas and highways exhibit higher accident densities.
* Driver negligence and speeding remain leading causes.
* Weekends see a spike in accidents due to increased travel activity.

### Outcome & Impact
* This project showcases my ability to:
* Perform end-to-end data analysis using Python
* Derive actionable insights from complex datasets
* Communicate findings visually through clear and impactful dashboards
