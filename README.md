# Walmart Sales-Data-Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL cleaning and Power Bi visualisation skills. I downloaded this data from Kaggle. This data contains walmarts sales across US states and cities from 2011 to 2014.

## Key findings:
1. California overwhelmingly dominates sales, accounting for over 63% of total revenue. Washington is a distant second, with other states trailing far behind.
2. Chairs and Phones are the highest revenue drivers, indicating strong demand for office furniture and communication equipment.
3. Copiers, while not the top in sales, deliver the highest profit, suggesting high margins in this segment
4. Bookcases and Machines are loss leaders, possibly due to high costs or discounting. Tables, despite high sales, have low profit, indicating margin pressure.
5. A few high-ticket items (like copiers and executive chairs) contribute disproportionately to revenue.
5. A small number of customers are responsible for a significant share of sales, highlighting the importance of key accounts.
